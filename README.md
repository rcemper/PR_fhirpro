## Scope
This package provides a number of tools which were developed to aid in the implementation of the [German MII FHIR profiles](https://simplifier.net/organization/koordinationsstellemii) in [InterSystems HealthShare](https://www.intersystems.com/interoperability-platform/).  These tools are not intended for production use.

Many thanks to our sponsor for this project, the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany :tada:

## Installation
### Import Classes
- [ ] Import and compile the classes from GitHub in the *HSCUSTOM* namespace.

### Configure Production
A foundation-type production is required in HealthShare for retrieving SDA and FHIR. An installer method will configure this for you.

- [ ] From the terminal, use the installer script to setup the new namespace `ZIMPLFHIRPRO` and configure the production:
``` objectscript
HSCUSTOM> do ##class(HS.Local.zimpl.fhirpro.API.Installer).Install()
```
#### Now in the Management Portal:

- [ ] Configure the *Business Operation* **GATEWAY**
    - The **ServiceName** setting needs to use an AccessGateway known in the Service Registry, for example: `dembp18bthomas.local:HSACCESS`
- [ ] Configure the *Business Operation* **HS.FHIRServer.Interop.HTTPOperation**
    - The **ServiceName** setting needs an HTTP Endpoint for FHIR (ODS), for example: `FHIR.Service.R4`  
    If you use this standard service, you may need to configure the `HTTPCredentialsConfig` setting on the *Service Registry* entry.
- [ ] :bulb: Optionally add the *Business Operation* **HS.Util.Trace.Operations** 

- [ ] Start the production

### Web Dependencies
- [ ] Unzip and save the contents of 

`zimplfhirpro_Dependencies-*.zip` 

to the following directory:

`{HealthShare Installation}/csp/healthshare/zimplfhirpro/` 

### Navigate to the Startpage
<http://localhost:52774/csp/healthshare/zimplfhirpro/HS.Local.zimpl.fhirpro.UI.Index.cls>

## Disclaimer
:warning: This application is not supported by InterSystems Corporation. Please be notified that you use it at your own risk.

## Known Issues & Caveats
### 2024-01-12
- custom DTLViewer classes should now extend 
`HS.Local.zimpl.fhirpro.UI.DTLViewer`

## Roadmap
- Add REST API in ODS to handle ReloadPatient(), etc from this tool
